(ns kekkai.node.peer
  "One peer, end to end: the Noise IK session, the disco path state, and the
  routing decision that ties them together — pure, so the whole data plane is
  testable without a socket.

  Design points that took a decision rather than falling out:

  - **The session survives a path change.** A Noise session is bound to the two
    static keys, not to an address, so roaming from relay to a punched direct
    path (or between networks) does not re-handshake. `:route` is just where the
    next datagram goes.
  - **Disco pings ride inside the encrypted session**, as a framed inner type,
    not as cleartext next to it. An unauthenticated pong would let anyone move a
    peer's active path, which is a traffic-hijack primitive; requiring the pong
    to decrypt under the session means only the real peer can.
  - **Handshake retries are the initiator's job only**, per
    `noise.session/handshake-plan`. If both sides retried on the same trigger
    they would collide indefinitely; the responder answers and waits.
  - **Every datagram is tagged with its inner type before encryption**, so a data
    frame can never be mistaken for a disco frame by a peer running a different
    version — it fails to parse instead of being misinterpreted."
