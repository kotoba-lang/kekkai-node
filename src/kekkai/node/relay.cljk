  "The relay — this overlay's DERP equivalent — as a **pure** protocol core for
  both ends. `relay_server.cljs` / `relay_client.cljs` are thin sockets over
  these functions: everything that decides anything is here, so the routing,
  roaming and expiry rules are unit-testable without a network.

  Why a relay exists at all: two peers behind NATs that cannot be punched (both
  symmetric, or a firewall that drops unsolicited UDP outright) still have to
  talk. The relay is also the **signalling channel** hole punching needs — a peer
  cannot tell another peer 'try me at this address' over a path that does not yet
  exist.

  Three properties worth being explicit about:

  1. **The relay cannot read the traffic it forwards.** A forwarded payload is
     already sealed by the peer-to-peer Noise session; the relay only ever sees
     the destination's public key. Compromising a relay costs you metadata —
     who talks to whom, when, how much — and nothing else. Say that out loud
     rather than describing the relay as 'trusted infrastructure'.
  2. **Clients authenticate to the relay with the same Noise IK handshake** used
     between peers, against the relay's static key from the netmap. So
     registration is implicit and cannot be spoofed: the relay routes to the key
     the handshake *proved*, never to a self-asserted one. The cost is that a
     forwarded packet is sealed twice (peer session inside relay session); that
     is the same trade DERP makes running its own protocol inside TLS.
  3. **Roaming is allowed but must be authenticated.** A client's source address
     changes constantly (NAT rebind, wifi→LTE). The relay updates a client's
     address on any frame that *decrypts* under that client's session, which the
     replay window then keeps an attacker from replaying from a forged address.
     An unauthenticated address update would be a trivial traffic-hijack."
