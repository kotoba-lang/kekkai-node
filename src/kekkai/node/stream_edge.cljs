(ns kekkai.node.stream-edge
  "TCP forwarding over the kekkai overlay: sockets on both ends,
  `kekkai.node.stream` in between.

  This is the piece that makes `ssh judah` work without a TUN device. The
  forwarder listens on a local port; each accepted connection becomes one
  stream; the far side connects to a loopback service and pipes it back. To the
  user it is `ssh -p 2222 localhost`, and to `sshd` it is a connection from
  127.0.0.1 — neither end knows about Noise, NAT traversal or relays.

      ssh ──▶ 127.0.0.1:2222 ──┐                    ┌──▶ 127.0.0.1:22 (sshd)
                    forwarder  │  kekkai overlay    │  service
                               └── stream frames ───┘

  ## The two authorisation checks are not redundant

  The forwarder checks `netmap/permitted?` before opening a stream, and the
  service checks it again before connecting to anything. Removing either one
  would be a mistake of a different kind:

  - without the forwarder's check, a local user learns whether a remote service
    exists by watching how it is refused, and a stream is opened across the
    overlay for a connection policy already forbids;
  - without the service's check, the *only* thing standing between a peer and
    loopback is the peer's own opinion about what it is allowed to do. That is
    the shape `kekkai.node.netmap`'s docstring calls out about `fleet.edn`:
    'anyone who can edit it and reach a node gets treated as fleet'.

  The one that matters for safety is the service's. The forwarder's is there so
  a refusal is fast and legible.

  ## Backpressure is real here, not advisory

  A socket delivers bytes as fast as the kernel has them, and this transport is
  measured at 100–600 datagrams/s. `pause`/`resume` on the TCP socket is what
  keeps a fast local writer from turning into an unbounded queue in this
  process — the stream's window bounds what is *in flight*, not what a caller
  has handed over."

  "Encode and send stream frames to `peer`. -> nil, or the reason it could not.

  `reply?` picks `agent/reply-to` over `agent/send-to`, which is the difference

  by having been contacted.

  **Failure is returned, not thrown.** `agent/send-to` throws when the peer's

(defn principal-of
  "Which peer opened the stream behind the loopback connection whose SOURCE

  This is the answer `handle-open!` already has and used to throw away. It
  authorises a **proven** peer key and then connects to the service with an
  ordinary loopback socket, so the service sees `127.0.0.1` and every
  downstream authorisation that derives a principal from the peer address
  fails closed — measured, `test/principal_e2e.cljs`.

  The source port is the join. A co-located service reads `socket.remotePort`
  on the connection it is already holding and asks here; nothing is injected
  into the byte stream, so this works for a protocol the agent does not parse,
  including HTTP, and cannot corrupt a service that does not know about it.
  That last property is why this is not a PROXY-protocol header: a header is
  only safe where every service on the port opts in, and the failure when one
  does not is a mangled first request rather than a refusal.

  Two things it is NOT. It is not a secret — any local process may ask which
  peer holds a port, which is metadata about a host the operator already
  controls. And it is not stable beyond the connection: the entry lives
  exactly as long as the socket, because source ports are reused and an
